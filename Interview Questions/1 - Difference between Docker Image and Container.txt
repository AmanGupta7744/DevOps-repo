-> 3. Docker Image is Static template hence Immutable.

-> 4. Docker Image is less scalable. 
   4. Docker Container is Highly Scalable.
-> 5. Created from a Docker file.
   5. Created from a Docker image. 
-> 6. Highly portable.
   6. Less portable than Docker image.
-> 7. Docker image's contents cannot be modified once it's created means only read-only.
   7. Throughout their lifecycle, containers can be modified means read-write.
-> 8. Lightweight.
   8. Heavier than docker image.
-> 9. Image-level isolation.
   9. Process-level isolation.
-> 10. Images can exist without containers. 
   10. containers depend on images.
-> 11. Does not support attaching volumes and networks.
